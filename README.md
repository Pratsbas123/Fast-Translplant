Idea:

Organ transplantation in India comes with a varied number of unwanted discrepancies. Lack of an efficient centralized metadata to generate potential matches in real-time as well as transport issues and traffic congestions pose a major threat to successful transplantations in a diverse country like India. Efficient route tracking architectures coupled with proper statistical and data analysis systems can help generate roughly accurate database with potential matches spontaneously to tackle these emergencies and thereby reduce fatalities. 
Living donor - Kidney
Brain or Cardiac death - Can donate all organ
The goal of our project is to – 
 Locate cases of immediate transplantation due to accident or any other incident – 
Search the database & match which closest donor
Our implementation is based on the following methodologies:
1.	To host an interlinked database for all the hospitals (data of donor and recipient).
2.	Statistical Data Analysis to sort out potential donor-recipient matches.
3.	A GPS system to track the possible routes among the potential matches.
4.	Real-time traffic signal optimization
5.	Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest path from the donor hospital to acceptor hospital.
